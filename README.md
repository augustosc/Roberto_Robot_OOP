 ## Objective
  ROBOT ROBERTO was built for Ana Clara, Giovanna, Gabriel and all the grandchildren that 
  come along. The daughters and Cida will be able to enjoy.
 
  The objective was still to provide Ana Clara, in Canada, with the affection of part of
  her family who is in Brazil.
 
  To this end, numerous "good morning" messages from many family members were inserted
  to her, so that she has certainty that, even far away, we are close to her. She can
  listen to these messages whenever she wants through Roberto.

  It is also a memory that Grandpa (vov√¥) Sherman leaves, of his work, for his grandchildren.
  Every weld, every screw, every component, each wire, each line of this code had
  moments of effort, imagination, reflection and study by grandpa, to overcome the
  difficulties of building Roberto.

  In addition, there is grandpa's message to his grandchildren that to build something,
  even if it is a small robot, effort, work, obstinacy is necessary. I would like that
  my grandchildren had this awareness.
